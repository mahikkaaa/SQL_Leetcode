# LeetCode SQL Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode SQL problems. Each solution is implemented in MySQL corresponding to the problem's ID on LeetCode.

## Structure

The repository has the following structure:

```
.
├── Problem_ID_1
│   ├── problem_description.md
│   └── solution.sql
├── Problem_ID_2
│   ├── problem_description.md
│   └── solution.sql
└── ...
```

- Each problem is identified by its unique ID provided by LeetCode.
- Inside each problem's directory, you will find a `problem_description.md` file, which contains the problem statement and any additional notes or explanations.
- The solution for the problem is implemented in the `solution.sql` file.

## Usage

You can navigate through the directories to find the problem you are interested in. Each problem directory contains the problem description and the corresponding SQL solution.

Feel free to explore the SQL code, use it for reference, or modify it to your needs.
